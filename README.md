## Coding Project: Tour Comparison App Using React

An interactive travel explorer built with **React**, **Vite**, and modern state management techniques. This project fetches live data from a remote API and allows users to browse and filter tour destinations by name. Key features and skills demonstrated include:

- Data fetching and error handling with `fetch()`, `useState`, and `useEffect`
- Controlled form components for dynamic filtering
- Conditional rendering based on user interaction
- Component-based architecture (App, Gallery, TourCard, DestinationSelector)
- Interactive UI with real-time data manipulation and state updates

Includes support for card removal, filtering by destination, and refreshing when no tours remain.
